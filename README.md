# Human Inspired Robot Reaching Motions

For robots to be integrated into human environments, their motion should be predictable and human-like. Over a week at the summer school, we worked at Imperial College London's [Manipulation and Touch Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/manipulation-touch/) (MTL), analysing human reaching motion data and translating that to a robotic arm trajectory (OpenManipulator-X). 

How to navigate:
1. Project information can be found in the Project information.pdf
2. Data processing and nalysis is in the ROAG Data Analysis Jupyter notebook
3. Matlab code is in NEW_FollowTrajectory.m
4. CSV data converted from the original matlab data is in the all_participants_data.zip and the code to convert the data is in matlabconverter.py

Massive thanks to my teammates Emily, Camilla, Aaron and Thomas!
